# Practice forking an assignment repository and editing its files

## About forking
When you accept an assignment through GitHub Classroom, you get your own copy of all the files in it: a *fork* of the original. (Picture a fork in the road – a splitting off – despite the eating utensil in GitHub's animated forking gif.) This lets you safely play with and edit the files, without worrying that you'll overwrite someone else's work.

## Your task: use the "five principles" as a lens
For this particular assignment, I'm asking you to work in groups to apply the ideas from [Sorapure's "Playing Lev Manovich"](http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/8.2/binder2.html?coverweb/sorapure/index.htm). What do the "five principles of new media" help you see?

1. **Create a new file**, named for one of the five principles in Sorapure: numerical-representation.md, modularity.md, automation.md, variability.md, or transcoding.md
   - Note that filenaming convention: all lowercase, no spaces. 
   - The .md file extension lets you use ["markdown" syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), but you can ignore this for now if you want.
2. In that file, **make a list** of examples of where you've seen that principle in action.
   - What does this principle help you notice in [Wesch's "Information R/evolution"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4CV05HyAbM) video, for example?
   - What other examples from your digital day-to-day come to mind as you think about this principle?
3. Consider: Manovich was talking about "new media," not "digital media." Is there a difference? If time allows, **make some notes.**

EXT: If you finish early and are waiting for other groups, open the file "murray--four-affordances.md" and follow the instructions there.
