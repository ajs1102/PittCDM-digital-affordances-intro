# Practice forking an assignment repository and editing its files

## About forking
When you accept an assignment through GitHub Classroom, you get your own copy of all the files in it. This lets you safely play with and edit the files, without worrying that you'll overwrite someone else's work. For today, I've asked you to work in teams; for the major projects coming up, you'll each have an individual set of files.

## Your task: use the "five principles" as a lens
For this particular assignment, I'm asking you to work in groups to apply the ideas from [Sorapure's "Playing Lev Manovich"](http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/8.2/binder2.html?coverweb/sorapure/index.htm). What do the "five principles of new media" help you see?

1. **Create a new file**, named for one of the five principles in Sorapure: numerical-representation.md, modularity.md, automation.md, variability.md, or transcoding.md
   - Note that filenaming convention: all lowercase, no spaces. 
   - The .md file extension lets you use ["markdown" syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), but you can ignore this for now if you want.
2. In that file, you're going to **make a list** of examples of where you've seen that principle in action.
   - What does this principle help you notice in [Wesch's "Information R/evolution"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4CV05HyAbM) video, for example?
   - What other examples from your digital day-to-day come to mind as you think about this principle?
3. **Take turns** adding to the file, saving as you go, so that **everyone in the group gets to make at least one commit.**
   - Use meaningful commit messages.
   - Think of the main commit message as the subject line of an email, and the optional extension as the email body.
4. Consider: Manovich was talking about "new media," not "digital media." Is there a difference? If time allows, **make some notes.**

EXT: If you finish early and are waiting for other groups, open the file ["murray--four-affordances.md"](murray--four-affordances.md) and follow the instructions there.
